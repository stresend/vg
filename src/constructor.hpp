 * connected to when you connect to the start of the chunk, and a set of node
 * IDs whose right sides need to be connected to when you connect to the end of
 * the chunk.
 *
 * Node ordering is restricted: if there is a single source, it must be the very
 * first node in the graph with ID 1, and if there is a single sink it must be
 * the very last node in the graph with ID max_id. Additionally, single sources
 * and single sinks must be visited by only a single path, the reference path.
 *
 * The overall reference path must also always be path 0. Also, all mappings in
 * all paths must be full-length matches on the forward strand, and they must be
 * sorted by rank. Ranks must be filled and start with rank 1 in each path.
